# Non-Trivial-Pursuit
Animated MATLAB exploration of the "Homicidal Chauffeur Problem". Description of problem from Wikipedia:

>In game theory, the homicidal chauffeur problem is a mathematical pursuit problem which pits a hypothetical runner, who can only move slowly, but is highly maneuverable, against the driver of a motor vehicle, which is much faster but far less maneuverable, who is attempting to run him down. Both runner and driver are assumed to never tire. The question to be solved is: under what circumstances, and with what strategy, can the driver of the car guarantee that he can always catch the pedestrian, or the pedestrian guarantee that he can indefinitely elude the car?

# Project Description:

The predator function only knows the position vector of the prey function, and vice versa. The calculations within the functions labeled compute_f model a technique I came up with and presented on here:
[under construction]

Several constraints are set on the predator and prey "projectiles."
  (i) a force from their propulsion system (they can adjust the direction of this force freely, and can vary its magnitude within set limits); 
  (ii) a viscous drag force;  
  (iii) a random fluctuating force representing wind gusts.
  (iv) Both the predator and prey begin with a limited amount of energy (10 Joules).
