# Non-Trivial-Pursuit
Animated MATLAB exploration of the "Homicidal Chauffeur Problem" (Wikipedia search that string for more info).  


# Project Description:

The predator function only knows the position vector of the prey function, and vice versa. The calculations within the functions labeled compute_f model a technique I came up with and presented on here:
[under construction]

Several constraints are set on the predator and prey "projectiles."
  (i) a force from their propulsion system (they can adjust the direction of this force freely, and can vary its magnitude within set limits); 
  (ii) a viscous drag force;  
  (iii) a random fluctuating force representing wind gusts.
  (iv) Both the predator and prey begin with a limited amount of energy (10 Joules).
